# My Sublime Customizations


## Customizations include the following
<br>
<dl>
	<dt>Gulp integration</dt>
	<dd>
		I use a local server to communicate with gulp files so that I can get and display Sass compilation errors in the status bar. Multiple gulp files may connect at one time. 
	</dd>

	<dt>File size</dt>
	<dd>
		The size of a file is displayed in the status bar and updates on_modified (after 32 characters have been added or removed). The size is displayed in kilobytes "0.94 KB". 
	</dd>

	<dt>File save status</dt>
	<dd>
		The status bar will display "Unsaved" if a file is unsaved. If the file is saved, the status bar shows nothing. 
	</dd>
</dl>

 
## Commands
<dl>
	<dt>RemoveWhiteSpaceSelectionLinesCommand</dt>
	<dd>
		Removes selection lines that are just whitespace. It is meant to be used after split_selection_into_lines so that only lines that have text (not just whitespace) are selected.
	</dd>
	<dt>TrimTrailingWhiteSpaceInSelectionCommand</dt>
	<dd>
		Removes trailing whitespace in a selection of text. 
	</dd>

</dl>


## Build Systems
<dl>
 	<dt>NodeBuild</dt>
 	<dd>I use it to run NodeJS files.</dd>
</dl>
